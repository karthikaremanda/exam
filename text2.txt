Docker Commands
Login in DOcker and Docker Hub
Terminal as Adminstrator
docker --version
docker pull hello world
docker images
docker run --name container name -d image_name //-d app will run on front end so we give -d
docker ps -a ??gives all containers running or not running
docker rm <container id>
docker rmi <image name>
docker pull redis

Deploying a local image in docker 
Create a folder in that create a new folder with project name so now we implement redis so redis
create a new txt document name Dockerfile and remove extension so that the file type is file
docker build -t name . //. is required
docker login
docker commit <name> <username path>
docker exec -it <container name><required feild>
docker push <container name>
docker pull <container name>


MiniCube 

minicube start //creates a Kubernetes cluster on local
we need to create ngix application
kubectl create deployement myngix --image=ngix
kubectl get deployemnts //gives the ngix apps running in it
//now in order to run outside kubernetis
kubectl expose deployment myngix --type=NodePort --port=80 --target-port=80 //helping expose deployment --type=NodePort helps in outside port access on port 80 --target-port is pod port
kubectl scale deployment myngix --replicas=4 //creating more 4 copies
kubctl get pods //gives pod info
kubctl port-forward svc/myngix 8081:80 //outside port 8081 comms with inside port 80

minikube dashboard //gives minicube dashboard launched
kubectl delete deployement myngix
kubectl delete service myngix
minicube stop


nagios

docker pull jasonrivers/nagios:latest
docker run --name nagiosdemo -p 8888:80 jasonrivers/nagios:latest

AWS

login into aws some infrastucutre
go to modules launch AWS Academey Learner Lab Accept terms
start lab in the opened the max time to be open is 4 hrs
then click on green light aws this is dashboard
click on EC2 where we can launch instances Elastic compute cloud
launch instance button
give a name 

we go in quick start and click ubuntu
in instance type we t2.micro 
click on create key pair for secure connection 
give a name type RSA format .pem
save it in folder
in network settings the check boxes are needed to be ticked
checkout storage and create the instance
come out and you select the check box of the instance and click connect aftersome time
connect via ssh
go to the path where you saved the .pem file
copy paste the given command 
the saved project is stored in GitHub
you hosted ubuntu in aws where we type sudo apt update,sudo apt-get install docker.io,sudo apt install git,sudo apt install nano
clone the repo into this
create a Dokcerfile nano Dockerfile
FROM ngix:alpine
COPY ./usr/share/ngix/html save and exit
sudo docker build -t mywebapp .
sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 mywebapp

now back to aws site we are now in connect to instance go one directory back on above and copy the ip if not working remove https and keep http


create a new instance 
new name
quick start ubuntu
create keypair and save it
all check boxes in network setting
select and connect
copy ssh command and go to the path where the keypair is stored
paste 
sudo apt update,sudo apt-get install docker.io,sudo apt install git,sudo apt install nano
clone the repo
nano Dockerfile
FROM tomcat:9-jdk11/21
COPY target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/
save and exit
sudo docker build -d --name mavenProject
sudo docker run -d -p:9090:8080 mavenProject
now back to aws site we are now in connect to instance go one directory back on above and copy the ip if not working remove https and keep http
sometimes the port maynot be avaialbe so we need to go to instances and security bottom
in that if we have 9090 port it when we scroll down and table is chill else
if not scrool up security groups click it
edit inbound rules
constom TCP 9090 0.0.0.0

Here’s the full, simple setup to connect your local Git to your GitHub account.

✅ 1. Set your Git username & email

(GitHub uses your email to associate commits.)

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"

✅ 2. Create an SSH key (recommended)

This lets you push to GitHub without typing your password.

Generate a new SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"


Press Enter for defaults.

Add the key to the SSH agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

Copy the SSH public key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub


Copy the output.

✅ 3. Add the SSH key to GitHub

Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys

Click New SSH key

Paste the key → Save

✅ 4. Test the connection
ssh -T git@github.com


If it works, you’ll see:

Hi <your-username>! You've successfully authenticated...

✅ 5. Clone a repo or create a new one
Clone via SSH:
git clone git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git

Or create a new repo:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git
git push -u origin main

🎉 You’re done

Your computer is now fully linked to your GitHub account.

If you want, tell me your OS (Windows/macOS/Linux) and I’ll tailor the steps or fix any errors you get.
